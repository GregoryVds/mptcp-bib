abstract={User cooperation exploits nearby mobile devices as relays and offers an opportunity to enable multipath transmission for multi-homed mobile devices, even when there is no multiple access coverage. MPTCP by Internet Engineering Task Force is a promising solution to support simultaneous delivery of TCP packets over multiple paths. One key component of MPTCP is the coupled congestion control algorithm, which aims to aggregate available bandwidths of multiple paths while avoiding aggressive behavior to regular single-path TCP traffic sharing the paths. However, we find out that in a user cooperation scenario, the throughput of local single-path traffic of relays can be severely degraded by forwarding subflows of MPTCP, which can jeopardize the motivation for user cooperation. In this article we propose extensions to the congestion control of MPTCP for a user cooperation scenario in the Long Term Evolution network. The local traffic at relays can be controlled by regular TCP and more generic additive-increase and multiplicativedecrease protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that our extensions do not degrade performance for adding MPTCP subflows to local traffic, and thus better promote user cooperation.},

abstract={Multipath TCP (MP-TCP) has the potential to greatly improve application performance by using multiple paths transparently. We propose a fluid model for a large class of MP-TCP algorithms and identify design criteria that guarantee the existence, uniqueness, and stability of system equilibrium. We clarify how algorithm parameters impact TCP-friendliness, responsiveness, and window oscillation and demonstrate an inevitable tradeoff among these properties. We discuss the implications of these properties on the behavior of existing algorithms and motivate our algorithm Balia (balanced linked adaptation), which generalizes existing algorithms and strikes a good balance among TCP-friendliness, responsiveness, and window oscillation. We have implemented Balia in the Linux kernel. We use our prototype to compare the new algorithm to existing MP-TCP algorithms.},

	abstract = "{With the 20th anniversary of IPv6 nearing quickly, a growing number of Internet service providers~(ISPs) now offer their customers both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity. This makes multi-homing with IPv4 and IPv6 increasingly common even with just a single ISP connection. Furthermore, the growing popularity of multi-path transport, especially Multi-Path TCP~(MPTCP) that is the extension of the well-known Transmission Control Protocol~(TCP), leads to the question of whether this identity duality can be utilized for improving application performance in addition to providing resilience. In this paper, we first investigate the AS-level congruency of IPv4 and IPv6 paths in the Internet. We find that more than 60\% of the current IPv4 and IPv6 AS-paths are non-congruent at the AS-level, which motivates us to explore how MPTCP can utilize the IPv4/IPv6 identity duality to improve data transfer performance. Our results show that MPTCP, even with a single dual-stack Internet connection, can significantly improve the end-to-end performance when the underlying paths are non-congruent. The extent of the improvement can reach up to the aggregate of the IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidth.}",
